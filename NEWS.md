# fdasrvf 2.0.1

* Added functionalities to `kmeans_align()` (#24). Specifically:

  - it gains the argument `use_verbose` which allows the user to suppress 
  information displayed in the console;
  - it includes a numeric vector storing the distances to corresponding center 
  for each curve in the output;
  - it is now possible to use the *medoid* as centroid type as an alternative to 
  the mean; the medoid is the most central curve among the existing curves.

(#23).
